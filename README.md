# Module 21 Homework Challenge: SMS Spam Detector

App/Code file: gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb

Note: I wasn't able to generate the external link. I disabled my firewall, security, etc., and consulted with the instructional team during office hours to figure it out. Unfortunately, we haven't found a solution.

However:

- The local URL does indeed work.
- A classmate ran my code on their system and the external link successfully generated. So, this might work for you after all.
